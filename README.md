## Build Instructions

See the [Build Instructions wiki page](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner/wiki/Build-Instructions) for information on how to build gtest-runner from source on your platform.

## Installers

Check out the [Latest release](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner/releases) for binary installers. 

_NOTE_: We're still in the process of acquiring certificates to sign the windows binaries, which should happen within the next couple of releases. For now, if you use the .exe installer, you'll get a lot of warnings about potentially unsafe code. If you have admin rights to your machine you can 'continue anyway' through those messages to finish the install.
